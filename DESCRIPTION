Description: An implementation of the metrics dief@t and dief@k to measure the diefficiency (or continuous efficiency) of incremental approaches, see Acosta, M., Vidal, M. E., & Sure-Vetter, Y. (2017). Diefficiency metrics: Measuring the continuous efficiency of query processing approaches. In International Semantic Web Conference (pp. 3-19). Springer, Cham. <doi:10.1007/978-3-319-68204-4_1>. The metrics dief@t and dief@k allow for measuring the diefficiency during an elapsed time period t or while k answers are produced, respectively. dief@t and dief@k rely on the computation of the area under the curve of answer traces, and thus capturing the answer rate concentration over a time interval.
